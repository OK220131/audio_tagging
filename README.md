# audio_tagging(PANNs inferece)

**panns_inference** provides an easy to use Python interface for audio tagging and sound event detection. The audio tagging and sound event detection models are trained from PANNs: Large-Scale Pretrained Audio Neural Networks for Audio Pattern Recognition: https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn

## Installation
PyTorch>=1.0 is required.
```
$ pip install panns-inference
$ pip install numba==0.56.4
```

## Usage
```
$ python test.py
```
